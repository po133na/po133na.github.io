# uiuxproject
Final Project for UI/UX elective course

I've made the delivery app project. People can order 6 type of things here like food, groceries, pharmacy, snacks and random things. In my designed app people can log in/sign up, edit profile data in settings, chat with app support and it can remember their payment data. App is made in light tones, for instance, green, beige, yellow and etc. There is animation for better user interaction experience. Enjoy ig
